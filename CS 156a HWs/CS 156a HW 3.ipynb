For example, let the $4$ points be $(0, 0, 0), (1, 0, 0), (0, 0, 1), (0, 1, 0)$. We can write the coordinates in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ as $(x_1,x_2,x_3)$. Each of these point I choose is either the origin or has only one entry which is $1$ and all the other $0$. We can choose a plane $P$ for different situations:\n","*   Separate the origin from others: $P: x_1+x_2+x_3=\\frac{1}{2}$\n","*   Separate the point with $x_i = 1$ from others: $P:x_i=\\frac{1}{2}$\n","*   Separate the point with $x_i = 1$ and the point with $x_j = 1$ from others: $P: x_i+x_j=\\frac{1}{2}$\n","  \n","The cases above cover all the situations. Hence, all $2^4=16$ combinations of returned value are possible. Thus, $4$ is not a break point.  \n","We now proceed to prove that $5$ is a break point. For any set of $5$ points, if there are $3$ of them that are colinear, by setting the \"middle\" point to return $+1$ and the points on the sides to return $-1$, we get a combination that is impossible to be separated. This is because any plane will intersect this line at a point, which results in a situation similar to \"positive ray\".  \n","Also, there can't be $4$ points that are in the same plane, otherwise we can use our argument for $2D$ perceptron to find impossible combinations.  \n","If we consider the general situation where no $3$ points are colinear and no $4$ points are in the same plane, we can choose the returned value combinations such that $3$ points return $+1$ and form a plane $P_{+1}$, and the remaining points return $-1$ and form a line $L_{-1}$ that crosses the plane.  \n","In this case, if we want to make sure all points in $P_{+1}$ return $+1$, we have to make our separating plane parallel to $P_{+1}$, however, this will inevitably result in at least one point in $L_{-1}$ returing $+1$ instead of $-1$.\n","\n","Therefore, we can conclude that $5$ is a break point since for any choices of points, we will find at least one combination of returned value that is impossible to be achieved by our separating plane.\n","\n","And since $4$ is not a break point, we conclude that $5$ is the smallest break point.\n","\n","Thus, the answer to question 4 is **[b]**.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"WPYuzIsGKDij"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["##Question 5##\n","Here **i** and **v** are example 1 and example 3 in the lecture slides.
